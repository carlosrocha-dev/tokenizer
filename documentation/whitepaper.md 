# IMERSIVUS42 Project – Whitepaper

## 1. Introduction

The **IMERSIVUS42 Project** is a minimalistic prototype of a futures exchange deployed on the **BNB Smart Chain Testnet**. It demonstrates how an ERC‑20 token, a price oracle, and an exchange contract can interact to create a simplified environment for futures trading.

This project is **educational in nature**, designed to showcase smart contract design, deployment, verification, and interaction with blockchain explorers and wallets.

## 2. System Components

### 2.1 IMERSIVUS42Token

* **Type:** ERC‑20 token based on OpenZeppelin libraries.
* **Ticker:** IMERSIVUS42
* **Supply:** 21,000,000 IMERSIVUS42 minted at deployment.
* **Role:** Provides the currency used for deposits, positions, and withdrawals in the exchange.

### 2.2 MockOracle

* **Purpose:** Supplies a simulated asset price (manually updated by the owner).
* **Usage:** Price is expressed as an integer with 8 decimal places (e.g., `100000000` = 1.0).
* **Role:** Serves as the market price feed for futures contracts.

### 2.3 FuturesExchange

* **Purpose:** Core trading contract.
* **Features:**

  * Deposit IMERSIVUS42 tokens.
  * Open a **long** or **short** futures position.
  * Close positions to calculate **profit/loss (PnL)** based on price changes.
  * Withdraw available balance back to wallet.
* **Margin Discount:** 80% of the deposited amount is used as effective margin.

## 3. Workflow

1. **Wallet Setup**

   * Configure MetaMask for **BNB Testnet**.
   * Add the deployed **IMERSIVUS42Token**.

2. **Funding**

   * Acquire **Test BNB** from a faucet for gas fees.
   * Request IMERSIVUS42 tokens if distribution is enabled.

3. **Deposits and Approvals**

   * Use `approve` to allow the Exchange to spend IMERSIVUS42.
   * Call `deposit` to transfer funds into the Exchange.

4. **Trading**

   * Open position via `openPosition(isLong, amount)`.
   * Update oracle price using `setPrice` to simulate market movement.
   * Close position via `closePosition` to realize PnL.

5. **Withdrawals**

   * Call `withdraw(amount)` to return tokens from the Exchange to wallet.

## 4. Smart Contract Addresses

* **Token (IMERSIVUS42Token):** `0x93783d7E8097cba710922e9997aA1759C34A4618`
* **Oracle (MockOracle):** `0xE769449D1Ed5d4F6E7e2DB220DEe01b22554b979`
* **Exchange (FuturesExchange):** `0xF38ca9Ef40cc666Adad33E983121c1bdFE81383D`

## 5. Technical Specifications

* **Language:** Solidity ^0.8.20
* **Compiler:** v0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6
* **EVM Version:** Shanghai
* **Optimizer:** Disabled, runs = 200
* **Dependencies:** OpenZeppelin ERC‑20

## 6. Security Notes

* This system is **not production‑ready**.
* Oracle prices are manually controlled (centralized and insecure for real use).
* No liquidation, leverage, or advanced margin management.
* Educational scope: demonstrates mechanics, not production safety.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The **IMERSIVUS42 Project** illustrates a minimal futures market on blockchain:

* ERC‑20 token creation
* Oracle integration
* Futures contract logic
* Verification on a block explorer

It can serve as a foundation for learning **DeFi concepts**, smart contract workflows, and project validation for academic or educational purposes.
